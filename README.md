Project Purpose : In Australia, youth homelessness continues to increase, and with COVID-19, over 43k young
people (aged between 12 -25) are on their own accessing support services. These young people 
are not seeking adventure but have been forced into this lifestyle. The reasons
range from family dysfunctions, unemployment, lack of affordable housing, etc. Youths most
likely experience depression, poor nutrition, substance abuse, and suicidal tendencies, these
consequences are national problems that are devastating and must be responded to.

Project Solution :  Our IT solution aims to offer access to support services that are meant to prevent youth
homelessness. Our main motive is to reduce the incidence of homelessness to improve
outcomes for young people in the VIC region. The services listed will be custom-built, that is,
access to a housing option, which provides shelter along with education scholarships to young
adults, in this way we can prevent homelessness and keep them engaged in education and
connected with family and community simultaneously.
